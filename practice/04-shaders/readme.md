## Shaderific documentation

https://shaderific.com/glsl.html

Shaderific is an iOS application that lets you play with GLSL. The application is not something to care about, but the documentation isn't too bad.

## Kronos Group OpenGL reference pages

https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/indexflat.php

This documentation deals with OpenGL, but most of the standard functions you'll see will be compatible with WebGL. Let's not forget that WebGL is just a JavaScript API to access OpenGL.

## Book of shaders documentation

https://thebookofshaders.com/

The book of shaders mainly focus on fragment shaders and has nothing to do with Three.js but it is a great resource to learn and it has its own glossary.
